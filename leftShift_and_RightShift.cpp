/*
  Lets talk about left shift and right shift now   for example if we want to  do the left shift it will be like 5<<1 , the expansion of 5 is 94 bytes,32 bits)00000--------101 
  ,so its left shift means shifting one bit by left which means 0000000000.....1010.
  example; 3<<2,which  means  left shift 3 by 2 0000.....011 after 3<<2 will be 00000.....1100

  Lets talk about right shift now 
example 15>>1 o/p=1
NOTE :padding with always 0 in positive numbers
